When I first thought of hosting a website, I never wanted to create something too bloated with a bunch of JavaScript like many websites out there. Don't get me wrong, there are many websites that look great and they have tons of CSS and JavaScript; but that approach is not my cup of tea... I was looking for something simple and functional, that's why I went with the [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) framework + [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme, and I'm **really** glad that I did that.

Anyways, this my second post around here, I'm still improving a **LOT** of things. 

Until the next one. Byeeee.
