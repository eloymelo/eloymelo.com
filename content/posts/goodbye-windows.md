Well, I am back to Linux, and this time I believe it's for good. Before I tell you why I am completely switching, let me give you some context.

I've been on and off of Linux Distros for quite some time now. However, in late November of this year, I found myself in a pickle. Since I'm currently unemployed and with no money to continue paying for services like Proton Drive, Proton Pass, things of that nature, I decided to look into the self hosted aspect of things. I tried to do all of that using Windows, it kinda worked, but it felt wrong, I had some weird issues. Then I thought: "Now this is a great opportunity to install once more a Linux Distro and try it out over there.". I couldn't be more right. I installed Fedora 43 on my main tower, configured everything and I was ready to go. All working flawlessly with a server working with Debian as well, all perfect. I will definitely write a post about this whole process in the future.

So the main reason why I decided to go back to Linux is pretty simple: it just works and it doesn't get in my way. The thing with Windows is that nowadays I have to do a LOT of tweaks just to have a basic experience without system bloat, it's a pain. With Linux, I just install it, set my applications, configure some aspects of my desktop environment and that's it. Simple, straightforward. If I need something else, I will get that something else, I don't need an OS to shove down my throat what I should have or what I shouldn't.

If you are thinking about switching do Linux, please, give it a chance. You don't need to go all in at once. Create a dual boot method, go slow, see if it fits your needs. Don't hesitate to ask on forums if you have doubts, also if you want, ask AI about Linux related topics, be careful though, sometimes it just hallucinates and it does more harm than good. 

My point is that you have an option, an alternative. Don't be slave to Microsoft or Apple. If you want to use one of them, that's totally fine, I don't judge you. However, I guarantee you that you'll fall in love with computers again if you give Linux a chance.

Stay safe out there,

Eloy.
